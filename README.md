## Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
The Azure Resource Manager is at the core of the Azure platform and is used to deploy and manage Azure services. Every resource in Azure managed under ARM can be described and managed in a consistent way. It's very helpful to understand the Azure Resource Manager and how to work with Resource Groups.
> Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources: Resource Manager and classic. Microsoft recommends that most new deployments use the Resource Manager model. 

- [ARM Overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-overview/) - Get an overview of the Azure Resource Manager
- [ARM vs. Classic](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-manager-deployment-model/) - Understand the difference between ARM the Classic (ASM) deployment model.

### ARM Templates
ARM templates are JSON descriptions of ARM deployments which can be used for "Infrastructure as Code".
- [Deploying ARM Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-template-deploy/) - With PowerShell, Azure CLI or REST API.
- [Quick Start Templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates) - A Github maintained, vast collection of templates for common use cases to help you get started authoring your own templates or deploying simple solutions.
- [Template Authoring](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-authoring-templates/) - How to author custom templates.

## Infrastructure Services
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to the compute, networking and storage building blocks which allow you to build any kind of cloud solution. IaaS allows you to have maximum control on how you manage virtual machines, network configuration but requires you to invest in attaining robustness, availability and scalability in the cloud.
